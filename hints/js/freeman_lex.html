            💡 Even numbers are evenly divisible by 2 (divided by 2 with remainder 0). So to solve this mission you should divide input number by two, find the remainder and compare it to 0.

            You should use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp"> modulus operator %</a>, which returns remainder of division, and the equality operator (==).

        Here it is.
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
function isEven(num: number): boolean {

    return num % 2 == 0;
}      
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            The solution may be a little bit tricky. <b class="code">num % 2</b> already returns value, which may be used as bool, so we don't need <b class="code">== 0</b>. But for even numbers <b class="code">num % 2</b> will return <b class="code">0</b>, which in boolean logic means <b class="code">false</b>. So you have to use 'not' operator <b class="code">!</b> to invert bool value, because the function must return <b class="code">true</b> for even numbers. And the code is:
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
function isEven(num: number): boolean {

    return !(num % 2);
}       
        </pre>
