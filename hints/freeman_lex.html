    <div class="answer">
        Even numbers are evenly divisible by 2 (devided by 2 with reminder 0). So to solve this mission
        you should devide input number by two, find the reminder and compare it to 0.

        What instruments of Python should I use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should use the <a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/python-modulo-operator/#modulo-operator-with-int">
            modulo operator %</a>, which returns reminder of division and the equality operator (==).

        I generally understand, but need to see the final solution.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Here it is.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_even(num: int) -> bool:
    
    return num % 2 == 0        
        </pre>
        The solution may be a little bit tricky. (num % 2) already returns value, which may be used as bool,
        so we don't need (==0). But for even numbers (num % 2) will return 0, which in boolean logic means False.
        So you have to use 'not' operator to invert bool value, because the function must return True for even.
        And the code is:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_even(num: int) -> bool:
                
    return not num % 2        
        </pre>
